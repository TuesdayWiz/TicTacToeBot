# Tic Tac Toe Bot
Three iterations of a Tic-Tac-Toe bot I originally built as a class project

## [TTT Bot](TTT%20Bot.py)
Original version.  Created as a class project to learn the random module, nested "If" statements, and object creation

## [TTT Bot with GUI](TTT%20Bot%20with%20GUI.py)
First revision, incomplete.  My naive attempt to port the code from the command-line version to a GUI-based app instead of rewriting it.

## [TTT Bot with GUI (rewrite)](TTT%20Bot%20with%20GUI%20(rewrite).py)
Second revision.  Written from scratch with the *concepts* of the command-line version brought over instead of the code itself.\
Allows each player to be one of three things: 
- Human
- Bad bot
  - Chooses a random open space to play
- Smart bot
  - Looks at the current state of the board and makes a move based off of it
